# RepoWalker
Walk repositories that you own in python.

# Setup

First add your github token, you will need a token that has access to 'repo' for this script, and you can generate it at gitHub (personal token, classic) [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens).

Then you can add it to the .env file, or you can run the script under auth to do so.

  ./scripts/auth.sh
